# ✅ CASCADE Delete Fix

## Issue

The original error was:
```
Error: pq: update or delete on table "projects" violates foreign key constraint 
"tickets_project_id_fkey" on table "tickets"
```

## Root Cause

The PostgreSQL schema was created without `ON DELETE CASCADE` on the foreign key constraints. This meant:
- Attempting to delete a project would fail
- Manual deletion of tickets was required first
- The delete feature couldn't work as designed

## Solution

Updated all foreign key constraints to include `ON DELETE CASCADE`:

### 1. Projects → Tickets
```sql
ALTER TABLE tickets 
  ADD CONSTRAINT tickets_project_id_fkey 
  FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id) 
  ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

### 2. Tickets → Blocks
```sql
ALTER TABLE blocks 
  ADD CONSTRAINT blocks_blocker_ticket_id_fkey 
  FOREIGN KEY (blocker_ticket_id) REFERENCES tickets(id) 
  ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE blocks 
  ADD CONSTRAINT blocks_blocked_ticket_id_fkey 
  FOREIGN KEY (blocked_ticket_id) REFERENCES tickets(id) 
  ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

## Migration Steps

The fix was applied via SQL:

```sql
-- Drop existing constraints
ALTER TABLE blocks DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS blocks_blocker_ticket_id_fkey;
ALTER TABLE blocks DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS blocks_blocked_ticket_id_fkey;
ALTER TABLE tickets DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS tickets_project_id_fkey;

-- Add them back with CASCADE
ALTER TABLE tickets 
  ADD CONSTRAINT tickets_project_id_fkey 
  FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id) 
  ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE blocks 
  ADD CONSTRAINT blocks_blocker_ticket_id_fkey 
  FOREIGN KEY (blocker_ticket_id) REFERENCES tickets(id) 
  ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE blocks 
  ADD CONSTRAINT blocks_blocked_ticket_id_fkey 
  FOREIGN KEY (blocked_ticket_id) REFERENCES tickets(id) 
  ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

## Verification

Tested with a complete delete flow:

```bash
Before: 3 projects, 6 tickets

Deleting TODEL project...
Response: {"status": "deleted"}

After: 2 projects, 5 tickets

✅ SUCCESS! CASCADE delete removed project + ticket!
```

## What Gets Deleted

When a project is deleted:

1. **Project record** is removed
2. **All tickets** in that project are automatically deleted (CASCADE)
3. **All block relationships** involving those tickets are automatically deleted (CASCADE)
4. Data integrity is maintained
5. No orphaned records

## Benefits

✅ Clean deletion - one API call deletes everything  
✅ Data integrity maintained automatically  
✅ No manual cleanup required  
✅ Referential integrity enforced by database  
✅ Safe deletion with confirmation dialog  
✅ Works as designed in the feature spec

## Database Schema Now Correct

All foreign keys now have proper CASCADE behavior:
- `projects.id` ← `tickets.project_id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)
- `tickets.id` ← `blocks.blocker_ticket_id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)  
- `tickets.id` ← `blocks.blocked_ticket_id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)

Delete propagation chain:
```
DELETE Project
  ↓ CASCADE
  DELETE Tickets
    ↓ CASCADE
    DELETE Blocks
```

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Delete project feature now works correctly with automatic CASCADE cleanup!
