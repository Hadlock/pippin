# 🎯 Drag-and-Drop Feature Update

## What Changed

Added full drag-and-drop functionality to move tickets between columns on the kanban board!

## New Features

### ✅ Drag-and-Drop
- **Grab any ticket** and drag it to a different column
- **Visual feedback**: 
  - Cards show a move cursor on hover
  - Dragging card becomes semi-transparent with rotation effect
  - Target column highlights with accent border and scale animation
- **Validation**: Only allows moves to adjacent states (follows the state machine rules)
- **Error handling**: Shows alert if you try to skip states

### State Machine Enforcement
The drag-and-drop respects the adjacency rules:
- `backlog` ↔️ `todo` ✅
- `todo` ↔️ `in_progress` ✅  
- `in_progress` ↔️ `done` ✅
- `backlog` → `done` ❌ (blocked with alert)

### UI Enhancements
- Cards now have a **move cursor** indicating they're draggable
- Hover effect with solid border and shadow
- Smooth animations during drag
- Column highlights when you drag over it
- Minimum height for empty columns so they're always drop targets

## Technical Details

### CSS Changes (~4 lines)
- `.card` now has `cursor:move` and `user-select:none`
- `.card:hover` adds border and shadow effects
- `.card.dragging` shows semi-transparent with rotation
- `.col.drag-over` highlights with accent border and scale
- `.col-content` provides minimum height for drop zones

### HTML Changes
- Added `draggable="true"` attribute to all cards
- Added `data-id` and `data-state` attributes for tracking
- Wrapped card lists in `.col-content` divs

### JavaScript Changes (~60 lines)
- Added drag event handlers (`dragstart`, `dragend`)
- Added drop zone handlers (`dragover`, `dragleave`, `drop`)
- State adjacency validation logic
- Direction calculation (left/right)
- API integration for state updates

## Code Stats

**Before**: 531 lines (407 Go + 124 template)  
**After**: 629 lines (407 Go + 222 template)  
**Added**: ~98 lines (all in template for UI/UX)

Core Go logic remains unchanged at **407 lines** ✅

## Usage

### Mouse Drag
1. Click and hold any ticket card
2. Drag to an adjacent column
3. Release to drop
4. Page reloads with updated state

### Button Click (still works!)
- Click ← or → buttons to move tickets
- Same validation rules apply

## Demo

```bash
# Make sure server is running
./main

# Open http://localhost:8080/board
# Try dragging a ticket from Todo to In Progress!
```

## Browser Compatibility
